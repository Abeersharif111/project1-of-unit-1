## Your game's name:
Lollypop Hunter Game . 
As you a player you must help this kid to collect 3 or more lollypops to win the game , if 
you collect less than 3 lollypops then you will lose. 
If you want to play again you must click the Play Again button to restart the game. 
I choose this game because I can use the basic fundamentals and then I can go more 
advanced . 

## Getting started:

## Technologies used:  
- JavaScript. 
- HTML. 
- CSS .

## Next steps:
Planned future enhancements :
- At the beginning of the game there will be a basket that positioned at the ground in 
the right side of the lollypops , as much as he click red lollypops the basket will be 
moved to left side near to the kid  . 
- If the basket reach the kid then it will be great so the kid will dance . 
-  If he clicked a blue lollypop, the basket will move back to  the right far a step of the 
kid and the score will decreased by 1 and I want a message indicating that I have a 
fault. 
- If he clicked the black lollypop the basket will return back to its original location and 
the score becomes to 0 .
